 # Data Visualization - Bird Strike Visuals Final Project
The concept I will be analyzing for this project is aviation bird strikes. While this may seem a little boring at first glance, this dataset includes lengthy information involving the statistics of planes striking birds while flying. Whether it be the plane type, model, damage caused, or any other information regarding the condition and information surrounding the plane and the bird, it is included in thi dataset. In this project I will be exploring the relationships between planes and the untold common incidents of striking birds while in flight. I will visually compare and contrast conditions involving said bird strikes and whether there are commonalities between the planes, number of birds struck, weather, typical damage caused, and other factors related. 
# Techniques
A technique I think will be specifically crucial in visualizing these relationships will be graphing. Plotting out and relating seperate masks of this dataframe is going to be greatly important for this project in further exploring any similarities or differences. Interactive plotting is potentially helpful in this situation, as well as the usage of some correlation and fitting, and dashboards.
